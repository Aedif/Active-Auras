# Active-Auras

Active Auras will propigate Active Effects that are labeled as auras onto nearby tokens. 
The distance and targeting of the aura are both configurable.
Any ```@``` fields from DAE will be correctly parsed before being applied to the effected token.
Macros from DAE will fire once when applied and once when removed (work is being done for damage over time effects)

## Compatability
- Works with DAE as far as I know
- Multi Level Token should work fine, clones actors are ignored for purposes of calculating auras


## Notes
- Only works with a GM account currently connected
